# Design Patterns

**A programming language independent strategies for solving the common object-oriented design problems. A design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation.**



**When should we use the design patterns?**


We must use the design patterns during the analysis and requirement phase of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). 



**Categorization of Design Patterns:**
- **Creational Design Patterns**: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation. Some of the examples are: Factory Pattern, Abstract Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Prototype Pattern, Builder Pattern.
- **Structural Design Patterns**: These patterns deal with object composition to form larger structures, while keeping the individual objects intact. Some of the examples are: Adapter Pattern, Bridge Pattern, Composite Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Facade Pattern, Proxy Pattern.
- **Behavioural Design Patterns**: These patterns focus on communication between objects, with the emphasis on how objects distribute responsibility. Some of the examples are: Command Pattern, Iterator Pattern, [Observer Pattern](https://github.com/ramanks19/design-patterns/tree/main/ObserverPattern), State Pattern, [Strategy Pattern](https://github.com/ramanks19/design-patterns/tree/main/StrategyPattern), Template Pattern.



**Advantage of Design Pattern:**
- They are reusable in multiple projects.
- They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
- They provide transparency to the design of an application.
